# ChestXrays-DetectingPneumonia

## Background

This project involves the development of a deep-learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model was trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to classify images of chest radiographs as showing signs of pneumonia or normal.


### Steps to Develop the Model

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The dataset was sourced from publicly available medical image repositories. It includes labeled chest X-ray images indicating whether the image shows signs of pneumonia.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Images were resized to a consistent size (150x150 pixels).
   - Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the variability of the training data and prevent overfitting.

3. **Model Architecture:**
   - The CNN model was built with several convolutional layers to extract features from the images, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
   - A fully connected dense layer was added for classification, and dropout was used to prevent overfitting.

4. **Model Training:**
   - The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
   - Training involved using early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model was evaluated on a separate test set, achieving high accuracy and providing detailed classification metrics.

## Streamlit Application

The application provides a web-based interface for users to interact with the trained model. Users can upload chest X-ray images and receive predictions on whether the image shows signs of pneumonia.

### Access the Live Application

You can access the live Streamlit application here: [Pneumonia Detection App](http://your-streamlit-app-link)

## Guide on How to Use the App

1. **Uploading an Image:**
   - Click the "Choose a chest X-ray image..." button to upload your image.

2. **Receiving Predictions:**
   - After uploading, the application will display the model's prediction below the image.
   - The prediction will indicate whether the image shows signs of pneumonia or is classified as normal.

### Capabilities

- **Real-time Predictions:** Provides immediate results upon image upload.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

### Limitations

- **Model Accuracy:** Performance can vary based on image quality and characteristics.
- **Not a Substitute for Medical Advice:** The app is intended as a supplementary tool and should not replace professional medical evaluation.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The Pneumonia Detection App demonstrates the capabilities of deep learning models in medical image analysis. For best results:
- Ensure that the uploaded images are of high quality and properly aligned.
- Use the app as a preliminary tool and consult healthcare professionals for an accurate diagnosis.
